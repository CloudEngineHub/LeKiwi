# 3D Printing
> **Estimated time:** <span style="color:red">X</span> days

We provide ready-to-print STL files for the 3D-printed parts below. These can be printed with generic PLA filament on consumer-grade FDM printers. We tested on a [Bambu Lab P1S](https://us.store.bambulab.com/products/p1s) printer.

## Parts


| Item | Quantity | Notes | 
|:---|:---:|:---:|
| [Base plate]() | 2 | |
| [Drive motor mount]() | 3 | |
| [Omni wheel mount]() | 3 | |
| [Servo controller mount]() | 1 | |
| [LiPo battery mount]() | 1 | |
| [RasPi Case Top]() | 1 | |
| [RasPi Case Bottom]() | 1 | |
| [Workspace camera mount]() | 1 | |
| [Wrist camera mount]() | 1 | |
| [Modified Follower Arm Base]() | 1 | |
| [Follower arm](https://github.com/TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100) | 1 | |
| [Leader arm](https://github.com/TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100) | 1 | |


> **Note**: STL files are already oriented and ready-to-print. Make sure to enable supports where specified!


## Printing Instructions
Assuming you already have access to a 3D printer<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup>, follow these steps to print all the parts above.

### 1. Setup Printer
1. Calibrate the printer and level beds according to printer-specific instructions
2. Clean 

### 2. Print the Parts
1. Upload STL file to printing/slicing software
2. Enable supports if specified and slice. We tested with the following settings:
    - Layer Height: <span style="color:red">X</span> mm
    - Printing Speed: <span style="color:red">X</span> mm/s
    - Infill Density: <span style="color:red">X</span>%
3. If needed, upload G-code (slice file) to printer and print

### 3. Take Down
1. Remove printed part(s) from printer
2. Clean print bed if needed
3. Remove any supports from parts
